periodontics
**************
Periodontics
We treat complex periodontal cases with a mixture of non-surgical and surgical treatments, tailored to each individual patientís needs. Treatments include removal of the bacteria that cause the condition, education about how to manage the condition and stop it from progressing, and in some cases procedures to repair damaged bone and to re-contour the gums. We may use periodontal lasers for some treatments, which is more comfortable and less time-consuming for patients.

Gingivitis

Gingivitis, also generally called gum disease or periodontal disease, begins with bacterial growth in your mouth and may end, if not properly treated, with tooth loss due to the destruction of the tissue that surrounds your teeth. Most people will experience gingivitis at some stage of life, and the symptoms can be hard to spot. Things to look out for include:

Gums that bleed during brushing or when eating certain foods (blood on the toothbrush is a common first sign)
Swollen gums that may or may not be painful
Bad breath
Gum Disease

REPORT ANY SYMPTOMS

If you notice any of the symptoms above you should book an appointment with your dentist immediately. The early stages of gum disease can be treated with a visit to the hygienist and an improved home oral health regime, which your dentist or hygienist can advise you about.

Untreated, gingivitis can progress to the more serious periodontitis. Some people are more susceptible to the bacteria that cause gum disease, increasing their chances of developing periodontitis and making early intervention even more important.

Dental Implants
*****************
Dental Implant
Losing a tooth can be worrisome. Psychology has gone ahead to prove that tooth loss can create intense emotional distress in a personís life, to the point of severely affecting mental well-being. Also, in cases like this, smiling becomes difficult as you begin to be overly conscious. Dentures proved to be the solution for a missing tooth and still is. There has been a shift in technology birthing the use of dental implants as the solution to tooth replacement. They anchor on the bone, thus giving a rigidity around your mouth mechanism like biting and chewing. Also, with dental implants, you can wear your smiles ideally as there are no clues of artificial restoration if constructed by a skilled dentist. Oh! Did we catch you by surprise? There is a lot more to dental implants, follow me as we tell you more.

reserach

Laboratory research in dentistry and dental education use extracted human teeth as a model for simulation for ex vivo procedures. Human-borne tissues are the first choice of material for bond strength assessment. To obtain comparable results in dental material tests and to ensure microbiological safety, specimens must be stored under specific, uniform conditions. The aim of this paper was to present the contemporary view and recommendations on preserving extracted human teeth. The antimicrobial properties of the storage medium are a crucial aspect, as extracted teeth pose a risk of cross-infection. A classification of different methods (using solutions and otherwise) is presented and their sterilizing efficiency is compared based on the literature. The emphasis is put on the interaction between the storage conditions and the substrate. Tooth specimens should be biologically safe and have normal mechanical properties. The sterilizing process must be neutral for the enamel and dentin microstructure, because even a minor change can affect the adhesive bonding. Autoclave sterilization and storage in 10% formalin solution are widespread and reliable methods, although they do have their disadvantages. There is a need for further investigation in order to establish uniform recommendations on preparing and preserving extracted human teeth used for research purposes.

tooth brush
Brushing your teeth every day isnít just a way to keep your mouth feeling clean. Itís a way to keep your whole body healthy, too.

The American Dental Association recommends brushing twice per day, for 2 minutes each time.

When you brush correctly, you eliminate the plaque buildup and bacteria that can otherwise collect between your teeth and on your tongue. This can prevent gum disease and tooth decay, as well as promote a stronger immune system and a healthier lifestyle.

We cover the ins and outs of brushing correctly, no matter your circumstance.

What you need to brush your teeth
The first step to brushing correctly is making sure youíre prepared with the right tools. Youíll need:

a toothbrush
fluoride toothpaste
floss
mouthwash (optional)
Your toothbrush should be replaced every 3 to 4 months. If your toothbrush has been overused, the bristles can become frayed and brushing loses some of its efficacy.

A fluoride toothpaste thatís approved by the American Dental Association is the best choice for most adults.

Fluoride fortifies your teeth against decay. Some very young children shouldnít use fluoride toothpaste. However, the ADA still recommends that:

children younger than age 3 whose first teeth have come in can use a smear of fluoride toothpaste about the size of a rice grain
children 3 to 6 can start using a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste
Special fluoride-free toothpastes also exist for younger kids if youíre worried about them swallowing the toothpaste.

How to brush your teeth properly, step by step
Brushing your teeth should take about 2 minutes.
The simplest way to brush your teeth involves your standard plastic-handled, nylon-bristled toothbrush.

The entire process should take about 2 minutes. Practice timing yourself until you get used to how long 2 minutes feels when youíre brushing.

Lubricate your brush with a small amount of water. Put a small amount of toothpaste ó about the size of a pea ó on the head of the toothbrush.
Insert the toothbrush into your mouth at about a 45-degree angle to your gums and use gentle, short strokes to brush your front teeth.
Brush the outside surfaces of your teeth, making sure to get the back molars and upper areas of your chewing surfaces.
Flip the toothbrush upside down to get the inside surface of your top front teeth. Flip it back around to get the inside surface of your bottom front teeth.
Brush your tongue to get rid of any bacteria buildup or plaque that has gotten stuck there during the brushing process.
Spit out the remnants of toothpaste, saliva, and water into a clean sink. Finish by rinsing your mouth with cold water.

How to brush your teeth with an electric toothbrush
Brushing your teeth with an electronic toothbrush head is slightly different since the brush head rotates or vibrates on its own.

Prepare your toothbrush by rinsing it with a little bit of water. Add a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on top.
Turn on your electric toothbrush and start at the back bottom row of your teeth, holding the head at a 45-degree angle toward the gum line.
Applying light pressure, move methodically, one tooth at a time, buffing each tooth with the rotating vibrating brush head.
Switch to the back top row of your teeth and repeat, cleaning and polishing one tooth at a time.
Use the electronic brush head to stimulate and clean your tongue, moving it slowly across your tongueís surface.
Spit out the remnants of toothpaste, saliva, and water into a clean sink. Finish by rinsing your mouth with cold water.

How to brush your teeth with braces
Brushing your teeth with braces is pretty straightforward, but it does take a couple of extra steps.

Start by removing any rubber bands or removable parts of your braces. These should be rinsed before reapplying them to your braces.
Get your toothbrush ready with a little bit of water and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.
Carefully clean around your braces, including under the wires and pins.
Brush the actual wires of your braces so that theyíre free of any food particles that could cause plaque or bacteria buildup.
Brush your teeth as you normally would, moving from one side of your mouth to the other and spending at least 2 minutes on brushing.
Gently brush your tongue.
Spit out any remaining toothpaste and saliva. Rinse your mouth with water and check the mirror to make sure your braces have been fully cleaned.
How to brush your teeth with spacers
Spacers, also called separators, are temporary instruments that make space for braces and bands that your dentist plans to install.

To brush your teeth with spacers, you can brush as you normally would, with one crucial exception. Brush your teeth in a back-and-forth movement, instead of up-and-down strokes. This will help keep the spacers in place.

Check after brushing to make sure that all the spacers are still where your dentist placed them.


How to brush your teeth after wisdom teeth removal
After a tooth extraction, such as wisdom tooth removal, there are a few extra precautions to take when brushing:

Start with your toothbrush lubricated with cool, clean water. Donít use any toothpaste in the first few days following tooth removal.
Brush carefully as you normally would. Donít brush over the site where your tooth was removed. Do your best to avoid dislodging the blood clot and stitches at the site of your extraction.
Donít rinse at all until the day after surgery to avoid dislodging the blood clot. After the first day, rinse gently and carefully with water.
How to brush your childrenís teeth
Remember that children under the age of 3 may need to use fluoride-free toothpaste or a much smaller amount of fluoride toothpaste than an older child or adult.

A babyís teeth can start to decay from when they emerge from the gum line, so be proactive about teaching them good dental habits.

Use a soft, child-sized toothbrush, water, and a small smear of toothpaste the size of a rice grain (if under 3) or pea-sized (if above 3).
Slowly brush the backs, fronts, and sides of your childís teeth. Also brush the gums where teeth have not yet popped out.
Make sure to brush your childís tongue. Have them practice rinsing their mouth and spitting out their toothpaste.
How to brush your teeth without toothpaste
There are several alternatives to toothpaste that have become popular products in recent years. Some work better than others.

Whether you get stuck traveling and forget to bring your toothpaste, or if you just want to give more holistic teeth cleaning options a try, these are ingredients to consider.

Coconut oil
Coconut oil has antibacterial properties, which means it attacks the bacteria buildup in your mouth. It can also dissolve plaque, which makes it a decent alternative to toothpaste. It even fights tooth decay and gum disease.

While you should still use fluoride in your toothpaste, using coconut oil regularly has benefits of its own and can be used for ìoil pullingî or brushing your teeth without much risk or drawbacks.

Activated charcoal
Most people donít keep extra activated charcoal tablets laying around, so this option might not work if youíre just stranded in a hotel late at night without toothpaste (in which case, try calling the front desk instead). But pure activated charcoal and activated charcoal toothpaste products may be effective at cleaning your teeth.

But activated charcoal is abrasive and can wear down your enamel, which means itís not an alternative to use regularly.

It also lacks fluoride, so your teeth might be more susceptible to decay if you switch your fluoride toothpaste for this option.

Baking soda
Many commercial toothpastes add baking soda to their formula to give it extra whitening power. Baking soda does work to help lift stains off your teeth. Itís also effective at removing plaque.

A baking soda paste is a great option if youíre in a pinch and have run out of toothpaste for the night.

Baking soda lacks fluoride, so over time youíre missing out on the enamel-protection benefits of that ingredient.

Takeaway
The process of brushing your teeth may look a little different in different times of your life. But whatís certain is that thereís no circumstance where you should avoid or skip brushing your teeth.

Brushing twice a day for at least 2 minutes each time is the foundation of good dental health and a smile that will last a lifetime.
