periodontics
**************
Periodontics
We treat complex periodontal cases with a mixture of non-surgical and surgical treatments, tailored to each individual patientís needs. Treatments include removal of the bacteria that cause the condition, education about how to manage the condition and stop it from progressing, and in some cases procedures to repair damaged bone and to re-contour the gums. We may use periodontal lasers for some treatments, which is more comfortable and less time-consuming for patients.

Gingivitis

Gingivitis, also generally called gum disease or periodontal disease, begins with bacterial growth in your mouth and may end, if not properly treated, with tooth loss due to the destruction of the tissue that surrounds your teeth. Most people will experience gingivitis at some stage of life, and the symptoms can be hard to spot. Things to look out for include:

Gums that bleed during brushing or when eating certain foods (blood on the toothbrush is a common first sign)
Swollen gums that may or may not be painful
Bad breath
Gum Disease

REPORT ANY SYMPTOMS

If you notice any of the symptoms above you should book an appointment with your dentist immediately. The early stages of gum disease can be treated with a visit to the hygienist and an improved home oral health regime, which your dentist or hygienist can advise you about.

Untreated, gingivitis can progress to the more serious periodontitis. Some people are more susceptible to the bacteria that cause gum disease, increasing their chances of developing periodontitis and making early intervention even more important.

Dental Implants
*****************
Dental Implant
Losing a tooth can be worrisome. Psychology has gone ahead to prove that tooth loss can create intense emotional distress in a personís life, to the point of severely affecting mental well-being. Also, in cases like this, smiling becomes difficult as you begin to be overly conscious. Dentures proved to be the solution for a missing tooth and still is. There has been a shift in technology birthing the use of dental implants as the solution to tooth replacement. They anchor on the bone, thus giving a rigidity around your mouth mechanism like biting and chewing. Also, with dental implants, you can wear your smiles ideally as there are no clues of artificial restoration if constructed by a skilled dentist. Oh! Did we catch you by surprise? There is a lot more to dental implants, follow me as we tell you more.
